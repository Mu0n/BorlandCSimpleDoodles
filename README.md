## MIDISPK ##

MS-DOS compatible program that takes in MIDI in signals in port 330h and sends it out to the PC speaker.
One way to enable MIDI in cheaply on MS-DOS PCs is to depend on a gameport in a sound card like a Sound Blaster 16 or clones, where their gameport has MPU-401 capability with 1 pin reserved for MIDI in and another for MIDI out. I designed a breakout board called the 'PC Gameport party' that exposes all of that functionality and both joysticks 1 and 2 in one easy package that you can buy here: https://jcm-1.com/product/pc-gameport-party/
